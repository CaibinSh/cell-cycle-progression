# cell_cycle_progression

This repo contains algorithm I developed for analyzing cell cycle progression of single cell imaging data at Prof Alexander Loewer's lab. For details, see my [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.03.031). It quantifies EdU intensity, nuclei size, and Hoest intensity and uses semi-classification approach to determines cell cycle phase of individual cells. 

The file ‘endpoint_cell_cycle.m’ will guide you to these algorithms.
